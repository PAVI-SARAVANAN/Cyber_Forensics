SQL Injection detection using deep learning

In this project, I have implemented 5 ML classification algorithms such as Adaboost, Decision Tree ,SVM, Bagging classifier and KNN. I have also implemented deep learning algorithms. Their performance are as follows:



|Algorithm          | Accuracy Rate|	Precision|	Recall |	Error Rate |
|:------------------|-------------:|---------:|-------:|-----------:|
|AdaBoost           | 	0.9         | 0.99     |   0.73 |	0.07        |
|KNN	               |0.82          |	0.60     |	0.97	  |0.17         |
|SVM	               |0.85	         |1.0       |	0.44   |	0.14        |
|Decision Tree	     |0.92	         |0.99      |	0.73	  |0.07         |
|Bagging Classifier |	0.92         |	0.99	    |0.73    |	0.07        |
|ANN	               |0.95	         |0.85      |	0.98	  |0.04         |
|CNN	               |0.96         	|0.97	     |0.84	   |0.04         |
